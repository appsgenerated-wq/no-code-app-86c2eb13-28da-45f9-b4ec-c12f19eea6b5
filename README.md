# FlavorFind - React Food App

This is a complete food discovery application built with React for the frontend and Manifest as the sole backend solution. It demonstrates user authentication, data relationships (Users, Restaurants, Menu Items), and role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for customers and restaurant owners.
- **Restaurant Management**: Authenticated users can create and manage their own restaurants.
- **Menu Management**: Restaurant owners can add, update, and delete menu items for their establishments.
- **Public Discovery**: All users can browse and view restaurants and menus.
- **Manifest Backend**: All backend logic, database, and APIs are automatically generated by Manifest.
- **Manifest SDK**: The frontend communicates exclusively through the `@mnfst/sdk` for all operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd flavorfind-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    This project uses a `constants.js` file that is pre-configured to read from Vite's environment variables. You will receive your `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_APP_ID` when you deploy your Manifest backend.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Admin Panel

A full admin panel is automatically available at your backend URL: `${config.BACKEND_URL}/admin`.

-   **Default credentials:**
    -   **Email:** `admin@manifest.build`
    -   **Password:** `admin`

From the admin panel, you can manage all users, restaurants, menu items, and access policies.
